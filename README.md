# Apple.com Clone - CSS only

## Purpose
This project is a CSS only clone of the Apple home page.
The purpose of the project was to practice recreating a
pixel perfect version of a design, whether it be a clone
or a design handed to me by a design team

## Specs
Functionality has not been built in, so items aren't clickable,
but this clone is fully responsive, mimicking the Apple home
page not only on all screen sizes, but also during transition
while resizing the screen. The project was built in React JSX,
using components for modularity.
